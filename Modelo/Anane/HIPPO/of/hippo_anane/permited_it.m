% permited_it
% Returns a boolean if the proposed iteration is allowed or not.
% Customizable for each dynamic model.
%
% INPUTS:
% it            Structure with all iterations. Details of this structure
%               can be found in HIPPO.m.
% last_results  Structure with the last iteration. Details of this
%               structure can be found in iteration.m.
% 
% OUTPUT:
% answer        If the iteration is permited or not.
%
% NOTE: The new iteration is in it.new, which is a vector with ones if the
% parameter is fixed, and zeros if the parameter is still free.
